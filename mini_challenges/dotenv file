What is .Env Files In Python?
A .env file in Python is a simple text file used to store configuration settings, environment variables, and other key-value pairs related to a Python project. These files typically contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or configuration settings. The contents of a .env file are not meant to be hardcoded in the source code but are instead loaded into the project's environment during runtime. The python-dotenv library is commonly employed to read the contents of the .env file and set the environment variables, making it a convenient way to manage project configurations securely.

How To Create And Use .Env Files In Python?

Step 1: Create the .env file
In your project directory, create a file named ".env" at the root level to store configuration settings and sensitive information.

Step 2: Install the Module
Install the python-dotenv library by running the following command in your terminal or integrated terminal.

pip install python-dotenv

Step 3: Store Sensitive Data in .env File
In your .env file, define key-value pairs for your configuration settings. For example:

MY_KEY = "kishankaushik12353"

Step 4: Access the .env file
In your Python code, import the dotenv module, and use load_dotenv() to load variables from the .env file. Access the values using os.getenv("KEY") for each key-value pair defined in the .env file.

import os
# importing necessary functions from dotenv library
from dotenv import load_dotenv, dotenv_values
# loading variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# accessing and printing value
print(os.getenv("MY_KEY"))

Step 5: Compile and Run the Code
Compile and run the Python code. The program will utilize the loaded environment variables from the .env file, and the output will display the value associated with the specified key, such as "MY_KEY," demonstrating successful integration with the .env file.

üîê Safe Handling of Secrets in Python Projects
1. Never Hardcode Secrets
‚Ä¢ 	‚ùå Avoid this:
    API_KEY = "my-secret-key"
‚Ä¢ 	‚úÖ Instead, load from environment:
    API_KEY = "my-secret-key"

2. Keep  Files Out of Version Control
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")

# .gitignore
.env

‚Ä¢ 	This prevents secrets from being pushed to GitHub or other repositories.
3. Limit Logging and Printing
‚Ä¢ 	Avoid printing secrets directly in logs or console:
    print(API_KEY)  # ‚ùå Not safe
    print("API key loaded successfully.")  # ‚úÖ Better

4. Use Environment-Specific  Files
‚Ä¢ 	For example:
‚Ä¢ 	 for development
‚Ä¢ 	 for production
‚Ä¢ 	Helps isolate secrets per environment and reduce risk.

5. Use Secure Storage for Production Secrets
‚Ä¢ 	In production, consider using:
‚Ä¢ 	OS-level environment variables
‚Ä¢ 	Secret managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
‚Ä¢ 	CI/CD secret injection

‚úÖ Summary
Safe handling means:
‚Ä¢ 	Don‚Äôt expose secrets in code or logs.
‚Ä¢ 	Keep them out of version control.
‚Ä¢ 	Load them securely using environment variables.
‚Ä¢ 	Use proper tools for secret management in production.
